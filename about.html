        <h1>Where it all began</h1>
        <p>With the ACT fast approaching, I knew that I needed to find a productive place to study. My first instinct was to head to my local public library. Upon entering, I immediately noticed homeless individuals, the stench of urine and most importantly the lack of students that are my age. At that moment I knew I couldn't study there. My second instinct was to head towards Columbia University's Butler Hall to see if I could study at one of their facilities. I walked up to the information desk and asked if they had any opportunities for NYC natives to study at Columbia. I was met with an abrupt, "no such program exists." That's where we come in...</p>
        <p>We grant high school scholars access to university libraries during the summer. Students can apply for access through our website. Scholars will have to provide: proof of residence and a letter of recommendation from a teacher.</p>
        <p>Administrator's have the ability to confirm or deny the applicant through their own exclusive page. If approved, Summer Study Space will send the student a $30 entrance fee. In exchange, the student will receive a digital pass that permits access to that space. If denied, the applicant will receive a rejection letter.</p>
